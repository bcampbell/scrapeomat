# slurpserver

Provides an http server for serving up a slurp API.

With the -browse option, also supplies an html-based browse interface
for examining articles.

## building

Browse interface uses go-bindata to include templates/ and static/
directly into the binary, so no extra files need to be installed to
deploy.
So you need to do:

  $ go generate

to generate the bindata.go file, before doing:

  $ go build
